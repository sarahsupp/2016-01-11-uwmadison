# SQLite Setup 

These instructor notes were modified from S.R. Supp's notes from a Software Carpentry lesson, to fit the Data Carpentry material and mission. They have been merged with the lesson objectives and examples from [DC](http://www.datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology/) 

This lesson will demonstrate how to access the example database to be used in the next chapters. To be able to follow the instructions, you need to have the Firefox browser and the SQLite Manager installed. In a later chapter, you will learn how to create and fill a database, but first we would like to demonstrate how an SQLite database works and therefore we provide the database up-front.


#### Objectives

*   Establish the example database to be used in the next chapters.
*   Check that the database is available and which tables are to be found.


## Installation

In order to execute the following lessons interactively, please install SQLite as mentioned in the [setup instructions](http://uw-madison-aci.github.io/2016-01-11-uwmadison/install.html).

## Setup
Note: this should have been done by participants before the start of the workshop.

1.  Install Firefox
2.  Install the SQLite Manager add on: Menu (the three horizontal lines near the top right corner of Firefox) -> Add-ons -> Search -> SQLite Manager -> Install -> Restart now
3.  Add SQLite Manager to the menu: Menu -> Customize, then drag the SQLite Manager icon to one of the empty menu squares on the right, Exit Customize
4.  Open SQLite Manager: Menu -> SQLite Manager

Now, you are done with the setup and you can proceed to the next lesson.

#### Note on zooming:
By default SQLite Manager opens in a separate window and it is not possible to zoom in to enlarge the font so that it is more readable.

The way to do fix this is to:

1.  Open the SQLite Manager
2.  Click on the Settings button,
3.  Chose Start SQLite Manager in a new tab.
You can then use Ctrl - + to zoom just like any other web page.
